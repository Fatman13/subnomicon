When a connected peer receives the transaction, they verify its validity.

The node first gathers information from its peers about the latest archived segment headers to see whether any new data has been archived since it last synced. If new segments are available, it downloads the headers and verifies whether they form a chain. Once verified, it downloads complete segment data from the DSN, verifies commitments, and locally reconstructs blocks from pieces. The DSN Sync allows a node to sync hundreds or thousands of blocks in one shot by downloading archived data directly from the DSN rather than fetching individual blocks from peers.\nOnce the node has downloaded all missing segments and imported archived history, it switches to syncing the recent blocks from other nodes until it reaches the network tip."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"piece-retrieval",children:"Piece Retrieval"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another essential protocol implemented by the Subspace networking stack is piece retrieval.
