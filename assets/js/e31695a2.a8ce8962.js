In PoW protocols like Bitcoin, this requires controlling over 50% of the total network hashrate for a sustained period of time which is infeasible in practice. However, long-range attacks remain a serious threat in alternative consensus protocols that do not rely on proof-of-work.\nLet's show how a Proof-of-Space blockchain can be vulnerable to long-range attacks. An equivalent setup is also true for Proof-of-Stake protocols.\nSuppose in the first year of the blockchain's operation, all farmers were honest and have collectively pledged 100TB of storage. Now, suppose by the second year the total storage pledged reached 1PB, out of which an adversary has dedicated 200TB worth of storage. At no point does an adversary control more than 20% of storage, which is way less than a majority. However, using his 200TB, an adversary could rewrite the past year's history by participating in all past lotteries to win blocks back to the genesis and then grow a chain instantaneously from the genesis to surpass the current longest chain. This is possible because the adversary's resources are enough to win a disproportionately large number of past lotteries compared to his share of total storage. Such a long-range rewrite seriously threatens the security and immutability of blockchain history.\nOn the other hand, in Bitcoin it takes a long time to mine such a chain from the past and that chain will always be behind the current longest chain. Thus, PoW enforces an arrow of time, meaning nodes cannot \u201cgo back in time\u201d to mine blocks.

Based on a joint study with Supranational, we don't expect a significant speedup over the best AES implementation, even with an ASIC.\nTo achieve asymmetric verification time for the AES-based delay function timekeepers publish a set of intermediate checkpoints alongside the output, currently 8, spaced uniformly. Farmers can validate each checkpoint independently and in parallel to reduce overall verification time. Including checkpoints allows other nodes to validate the output ~7 times faster and use ~4x less power than evaluation by leveraging instruction-level parallelism.\nThe target number of iterations is currently set to ~183 million to achieve approximately 1 second per time slot on high-end CPUs.
