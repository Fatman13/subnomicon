Domains are the logical extension of our basic decoupled execution framework, taking it from a single monolithic execution environment into a modular and interoperable network of namespaced execution environments. Subspace supports a programmable and configurable notion of namespaced execution environments, which we refer to as domains. Each domain is its own programmable layer-two rollup, or application specific blockchain (app-chain), that relies on the consensus chain for consensus, data availability, and settlement. Domains allow builders to easily launch their own network without having to bootstrap a new validator set, while still receiving shared security and interoperability from the root chain. They aim to make deploying a rollup on Subspace as easy as deploying a smart contract on Ethereum.
