# The Subspace Protocol
Subspace is the first layer-one blockchain that is able to fully resolve the blockchain trilemma. 
![Trilemma](../src/Images/Trilemma.png)

This seemingly impossible problem is solved by virtue of Subspace’s unique storage-based consensus design, which allows it to efficiently price blockspace (the space on a blockchain that can run code or store data). Subspace does this by creating the world’s first two-sided marketplace for blockspace, allowing it to have a dynamic on-chain cost-of-blockspace and a stable off-chain price-of-blockspace. When combined with existing scalability frameworks, Subspace is able to achieve linear scaling of the blockspace as more nodes join the network, without sacrificing security or decentralization. This massive scalability allows Subspace to serve as the leading Web3 backend infrastructure provider supporting Internet-scale. 
## Scope
Subnomicon provides a comprehensive overview of the Subspace Protocol, covering the following:

2. [Architecture Overview](/docs/overview) - *The modular architecture and design principles.*
3. [Consensus Mechanism](/docs/category/dilithium-consensus) - *How Subspace achieves consensus through its storage-based design.*
4. [Network Architecture](/docs/category/network-architecture) - *How Subspace is structured as a decentralized network.*
5. [Decoupled Execution](/docs/category/decoupled-execution) - *How Subspace separates consensus and computation.*
6. Scalability (Coming soon) - *How Subspace achieves unprecedented scale.*
7. Blockspace Marketplace (Coming soon) - *How Subspace prices blockspace through a two-sided marketplace.*
8. Governance (Coming soon) - *How Subspace protocol is governed by the community.*
