# The Subspace Protocol
Subspace is the first layer-one blockchain that is able to fully resolve the blockchain trilemma. 
![Trilemma](../src/Images/Trilemma.png)

We have built Subspace from first principles to achieve scalability, security and decentralization simultaneously. At its core, Subspace introduces a novel storage-based consensus protocol that separates consensus from execution. This allows Subspace to scale transaction throughput and storage requirements independently while maintaining a fully decentralized blockchain.
 
## Scope
Subnomicon provides a comprehensive overview of the Subspace Protocol, covering the following:

1. [Architecture Overview](/docs/overview) - *The Subspace modular architecture.*
2. [Advancing Blockchain](/docs/advancements) - *How Subspace advances the state of blockchain technology.*
3. [Consensus Mechanism](/docs/category/dilithium-consensus) - *How Subspace achieves consensus through its storage-based design.*
4. [Network Architecture](/docs/category/network-architecture) - *How Subspace is structured as a decentralized network.*
5. [Decoupled Execution](/docs/category/decoupled-execution) - *How Subspace separates consensus and computation.*
6. Scalability (Coming soon) - *How Subspace achieves unprecedented scale.*
7. Blockspace Marketplace (Coming soon) - *How Subspace prices blockspace through a two-sided marketplace.*
8. Governance (Coming soon) - *How Subspace protocol is governed by the community.*
